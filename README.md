# play-1
Playing with different tech, making my portfolio.

This is my personal website to show my work portfolio and experience.  
It includes links to my github, linkedIn and a request to email me.

It's main purpose is to play with a few technologies and see what I can create.

## Getting started
1. Fork and clone down the repo.

```shell
 git clone CLONE_URL
 cd play-1
  ```
  2. Install packages and run the server.

```shell
 yarn 
 yarn dev
  ```
